| ADM-Phases ![ADM-Phases](https://github.com/vksmallcase/AI-WAVE/blob/main/Systems-Design/Architect-Practices/Architecture-Frameworks-ADM-Phases.png?raw=true)                | Defines a structured, iterative lifecycle that guides architecture work from vision through governance. Ensures stakeholder alignment and continuous refinement via embedded requirements management.                                | Follow the phased roadmap to plan, execute, and refine architecture outcomes in each cycle.                       |
| ADM-Technique ![ADM-Technique](https://github.com/vksmallcase/AI-WAVE/blob/main/Systems-Design/Architect-Practices/Architecture-Frameworks-ADM-Technique1.png?raw=true)           | Facilitates detailed modeling, gap analysis, and solution identification using artifacts like capability maps and roadmaps. Combines principles with tailored governance processes to drive consistent decision-making.               | Leverage techniques during phase activities to create artifacts that inform decisions and close gaps.               |
| Architecture-Deliverables ![Deliverables](https://github.com/vksmallcase/AI-WAVE/blob/main/Systems-Design/Architect-Practices/Architecture-Frameworks-Architecture-Deliverables.png?raw=true) | Produce clear, actionable artifacts—models, reports, and roadmaps—that document baseline and target architectures. Support governance, communication, and implementation planning through standardized documentation templates.      | Use provided templates to generate deliverables and track progress for stakeholders and governance boards.          |
| Architecture-Context-Model ![Context-Model](https://github.com/vksmallcase/AI-WAVE/blob/main/Systems-Design/Architect-Practices/Architecture-Frameworks-Architecture-Context-Model.png?raw=true)| Captures relationships between business drivers, stakeholders, and architecture change initiatives within enterprise boundaries. Provides a high-level view of the organizational ecosystem to inform scope, constraints, and decision criteria. | Populate and update the context model to define scope, constraints, and decision criteria throughout the project. |
