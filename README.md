# AI Architecture Lab: Building Intelligent Systems from Whiteboards to Workflows: 🤖

Welcome to the **AI Architecture Lab**, a living canvas of architecture sketches, design decisions, and hands-on prototypes focused on **AIOps**, **observability**, **AI/ML Usecases**,**AgenticAI Automations** and **data-driven system design**. Whether you're here to explore fault detection workflows or deep-dive into edge-based telemetry strategies—this is your launchpad.

## Goal:

To share practical, scalable, and modular approaches for designing AI-powered operational platforms. This repo documents real-world architecture choices, trade-off analyses, and intelligent automation blueprints developed across global engagements—from telecom giants to enterprise-grade SaaS AIOps solutions.

## 📐 What You'll Find

| Artifact Type           | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🧾 **Whiteboard Sketches** | Visual system breakdowns, reference models, cloud-native compositions |
| 📊 **Architecture Samples** | Visual system repesent how it interconnects and Constraints, assumptions, and rationale for key design choices |
| 🤖 **AI Solution Templates** | Sample code for observability, automation workflows, fault prediction, NI/ML Prototypes, NLP/LLM Prototypes  |



## 🛠 Tech Toolbox

**Languages**: Python, Shell, Perl  
**Cloud**: GCP,Azure, AWS, IBM Cloud  

## 💡 Why This Matters

Every diagram, script, and document here is grounded in production experience. These artifacts are built not just to be understood—but to be _used_, forked, and extended. If you're navigating distributed systems, event management, or AI observability, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute.
